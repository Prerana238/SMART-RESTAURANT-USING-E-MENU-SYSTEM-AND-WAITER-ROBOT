# SMART-RESTAURANT-USING-E-MENU-SYSTEM-AND-WAITER-ROBOT
Developed an automated restaurant system using Arduino Uno/Nano, TFT touch display, and RF modules to digitize food ordering.

Designed an interactive e-menu interface with real-time billing and integrated RF communication to transmit orders wirelessly to the kitchen.

Programmed a line-following waiter robot using IR sensors and motor drivers for autonomous food delivery.

Debugged hardware-software integration issues in the robotic system, ensuring seamless navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Demonstrated problem-solving skills by optimizing sensor accuracy and reducing latency in order processing.
